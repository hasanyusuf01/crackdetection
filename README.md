## Overview

The SAM model is designed for image encoding and decoding tasks, featuring convolutional blocks, attention layers, and normalization. It is structured to improve image feature representation and reconstruction through a series of encoding and decoding operations.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you'll need Python and the following packages:

- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- PIL
- scikit-learn

You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib opencv-python pillow scikit-learn tensorflow-addons
```

## Usage

The code is provided as a Jupyter Notebook and can be run on Google Colab. To get started:

1. Open the notebook `sam_5_0.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Run the cells to load the necessary libraries and define the model architecture.
3. Train the model using your dataset by preparing the data and fitting the model with appropriate parameters.

## Model Architecture

The SAM model is built using the following components:

- **Encoder**: Consists of convolutional blocks and attention layers to extract features from the input images.
- **Decoder**: Utilizes transposed convolution layers and skip connections to reconstruct the images.
- **Feedback Loop**: Enhances the decoding process through multiple iterations.
- **Normalization**: Batch normalization and layer normalization are used to stabilize training.
